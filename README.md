# UnorderedMap
 An assigment for the Accelerated Computer Science Fundamentals Specialization from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. In this assignment I learned the most common usage details related to this class and also learn about std::pair, std::hash, and see an example of how hash tables can make certain algorithms much more efficient.
